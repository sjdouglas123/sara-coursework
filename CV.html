          <h4>Work Experience</h4>
          <h5><i>February 2014 - July 2016 : Domestic Assistant at Alexander Scott's Hospital</i></h5>
          <p> I worked as a part time Domestic where I helped cleaning around the home, I also helped serve meals and did a tea trolley for the residents and their visitors. There are 3 different shifts I could be given on weekend, 8 am until 1 pm, 12 pm
            until 5 pm or 2:30 pm until 7:30 pm. I would also work 3 hours after school one day a week and in holidays I worked full day shifts which were from 8 am to 5 pm. As a domestic some of my jobs were to help with meals, do a tea trolley, hoover
            rooms, sweep and wash floors, make beds, dust and clean bathrooms.</p>
          <h5><i>August 2016 - September 2017 : Care Assistant at Alexander Scott's Hospital</i></h5>
          <p> I worked as a part time care assistant. This job involved helping residents with personal care, getting residents up in the morning, helping with serving food and doing tea trollies for residents and their visitors. My main role is to socialise
            with residents and always make sure their needs are fulfilled. I enjoy working as a carer as it means I get more time to spend with residents and to help them throughout their day. During school term my hours were usually 7am until 5pm on
            a Saturday and 4:30pm to 7:00pm one night on a weekday, and I work extra shifts in the holidays. After I left school in May 2017 I worked full time doing 36 hours a week until September 2017. I really enjoyed my work as a carer and helping
            the residents. Below is a photo of the care home. </p>

          <h5><i>October 2017 - Present : Customer Assistant at Marks and Spencer St Nicholas Aberdeen</i></h5>
          <p>I currently work as a customer assistant working most often on the tills in the food hall. My main jobs are assisting customer's on the till, refilling the shelves in the food hall and assisting on the pop up bank stall in the centre of the
            shop by ensuring all of our customer's are aware of the bank and its benefits. I currently work 2-6 on a Wednesday and 9-6 on a Sunday, and often pick up extra shifts where I can. I enjoy working as a customer assistant as it gives me a chance
            to deal with many different people a day and also a chance to get better at promotion of items through the bank and also on any items on promotion at the till point. </p>
